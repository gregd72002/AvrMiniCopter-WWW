General
0 1		- reset into normal mode
0 2		- reset into maintenance mode
0 3		- get number of SPI errors on AVR->HOST line
0 4		- reset barometer

AVR Testing:
255 0		- get AVR status
255 1		- get number of SPI errors on HOST->AVR line 

Motor testing (only works in maintenance mode):
5-8 [pin]	- motor pin (front-left, back-left, front-right, back-right)
250-253 [pwm]	- feed PWM to motor (front-left, back-left, front-right, back-right); motor needs to be initialized
254 [motor]	- init motor (0-FL, 1-BL, 2-FR, 3-BR); motor pin needs to be provided before


Example motor test:
0 2
==== WAIT FOR RESPONSE ====
5 3
250 1000
254 0
250 1070
==== MOTOR SHOULD SPIN ====
250 1000


Config:
2 [log]		- log mode (see log section)
3 [mode]	- fly mode (0-stab, 1-acro)
4 [gyro_o]	- gyro orientation; this is a single value that represent gyro orientation
17 [pwm]	- standby throttle - this value will be fed to motors when on stadby
18 [pwm]	- start throttle threshold - should be set to around 5% above standby throttle
70-224		- PID configurations

255 2		- arm motors (status = 2); this should only be executed after configuration! (double check item 17 & 18)
255 254		- dummy

Run:
10 [yaw]	- desired yaw rate
11 [pitch]	- desired pitch
12 [roll]	- desired roll
13 [throttle]	- desired throttle
14 [alt]	- feed recent altitude measurement in cm
15 0/1		- engage/disengage altitude hold
16 [val]	- change target altitude by [val] in cm

Status reponses (to request: 255 0):
0		- early init
1		- maintenance mode (awaiting config or command)
2		- arm motors
3		- initialize mpu
4		- calibrate gyro
5		- running
253		- loop execution failure - mpu error (mpu fifo full?)  
254		- loop execution failure due to lag (avr is flooded with messages?) 
255		- gyro calibration failed 


Received values (depends on log setting):
20-23 		- accel reading min (g-force) multiplied by 1000;
25-27		- accel reading max (g-force) multiplied by 1000;

1-3		- gyro reading; multiplied by 100; (yaw, pitch, roll);

5-8		- quaternion reading; multiplied by 100; (yaw, pitch, roll, yaw target);

10-13		- motor calculated PWM
249		- Wifi RSSI measurement
