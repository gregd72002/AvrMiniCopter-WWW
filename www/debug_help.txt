General
0 1		- reset into normal mode
0 2		- reset into maintenance mode
0 3		- get number of SPI errors on AVR->HOST line
0 5		- get RPI status (0=ok; 1=SPI buf overflow; 2=AVR connection quality issues)

AVR Testing:
255 0		- get AVR status
255 1		- get number of SPI errors on HOST->AVR line 
255 2		- (internal) (status = 2); this should only be executed after configuration! (double check item 17 & 18)
255 3		- get SPI output buffer size
255 4		- get SPI input buffer size
255 5		- get last loop execution time (ms)
255 6		- get 'failsafe' status
255 7		- get 'code'
255 8		- get number of MPU errors

Motor testing (only works in maintenance mode):
5 [order]	- motor pin order for FL, BL, FR, BR: (0,1,2,3) => pin(9,3,6,4)  mask: (0x3, 0xC, 0x30, 0xC0)
6 		- init motors (make sure to feed 5 and 17 before)
250-253 [pwm]	- feed PWM to motor (FL, BL, FR, BR); motor needs to be initialized


Example motor test:
0 2
==== WAIT FOR RESPONSE ====
5 228 
17 1008
6 0
250 1070
==== MOTOR SHOULD SPIN ====
250 1008


Config:
2 [log]		- log mode (see log section)
3 [mode]	- fly mode (0-stab, 1-acro)
4 [gyro_o]	- gyro orientation; this is a single value that represent gyro orientation
17 [pwm]	- standby throttle - this value will be fed to motors when on stadby
18 [pwm]	- start throttle threshold - should be set to around 5% above standby throttle
70-224		- PID configurations


Run:
10 [yaw]	- desired yaw rate
11 [pitch]	- desired pitch
12 [roll]	- desired roll
13 [throttle]	- desired throttle
14 [alt]	- feed recent altitude measurement in cm
15 0/1		- engage/disengage altitude hold
16 [val]	- change target altitude by [val] in cm

Status reponses (to request: 255 0):
0		- early init
1		- maintenance mode (awaiting config or command)
2		- arm motors
3		- initialize mpu
4		- calibrate gyro
5		- running
250		- MPU initialization failed
251		- crash detected
252		- failsafe landing failed! (exceeded allowed time)
253		- loop execution failure - mpu error (if code -127 mpu fifo full)  
254		- failsafe landing successful
255		- gyro calibration failed 

Code responses (to request: 255 7)
1		- loop execution failure due to lag (avr is flooded with messages?); failsafe landing 
2		- alt hold failed due to no altitude data (i.e. baro failed)
-127		- mpu fifo full




Received values (depends on log setting):
20-23 		- accel reading min (g-force) multiplied by 1000;
25-27		- accel reading max (g-force) multiplied by 1000;

1-3		- gyro reading; multiplied by 100; (yaw, pitch, roll);

5-8		- quaternion reading; multiplied by 100; (yaw, pitch, roll, yaw target);

10-13		- motor calculated PWM
249		- Wifi RSSI measurement
